\begin_layout Problem
(20 points) Consumer Theory with the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference.
 WARP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\mathbb{R}_{+}^{L}$
\end_inset

 be the standard commodity space with 
\begin_inset Formula $L\geq2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Define a preference function 
\begin_inset Formula $r:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 associated with a preference relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq\subseteq X\times X$
\end_inset

,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq y$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in X$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)>0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succ y$
\end_inset

).
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq$
\end_inset

 may not be rational.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Consider the following particular model of consumer behavior.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}$
\end_inset

,
 let 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}$
\end_inset

 be a a finite collection of utilities such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j}$
\end_inset

,
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u:X\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 it's a utility function that is continuous,
 strictly monotone and concave.
 Now,
 consider a consumer that has the following preferences (multiple-utility–MU–model):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(x,y)=\max_{j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}}\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y)).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Intuitively,
 this MU model says that the consumer does not have a single utility to compare between any two consumption bundles,
 it may have many such utilities.
 In order to decide if she likes 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 better than 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
 this consumer first picks the worst case over a particular criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

,
 and then if there is at least one criterion (some 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))\geq0$
\end_inset

 the comparison is favorable to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
 then it will declare that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 (i.e.,
 the max over 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the previous statement).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A\subseteq}2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

 be a collection of menus/choice sets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We define a choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c:\mathcal{A}\to2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)\subseteq A$
\end_inset

.
 We say that a choice correspondence admits a MU preference function rationalization if
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c(A)=\{a\in A:r(a,b)\geq0\forall b\in A\},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a MU such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)=\max_{j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}}\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in X$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq^{D}$
\end_inset

 be defined as the direct revealed preference such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y\iff x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succ^{D}y\iff x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $y\notin c(A)$
\end_inset

.
 We say WARP holds if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y$
\end_inset

 implies not 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Show that associated preferences 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq$
\end_inset

 to the MU preference function above may fail to be rational.
 Hint:
 Build a particular model that fails transitivity or completeness,
 that it's a MU preference function.
 You can simplify the problem assuming for this numeral only that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is finite and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 consists of tuples and triples 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y\},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Show that when the multiple criteria are coherent,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}\cap U_{i}\neq\emptyset$
\end_inset

,
 then a choice correspondence that admits a MU preference function rationalization satisfies WARP.
 Namely,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y$
\end_inset

 then it cannot be that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 (Partial converse) Assume now that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is such that it contains every tuple and triple choice set such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y\},\{x,y,z\}\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in X$
\end_inset

.
 Show that if a choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 defined on this collection of choice sets satisfies WARP then there is a MU preference function that rationalizes it.
 For this exercise you can assume that the preference relation that rationalizes this data set is a continuous preference relation and that 
\begin_inset Formula $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{L}$
\end_inset

.
 (Hint:
 note that we are assuming that the choice correspondence it's nonempty).

2.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

 it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 such that there is one 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}^{*}}(u(x)-u(y))\geq0$
\end_inset

,
 then assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

 this would mean that there is some set 
\begin_inset Formula $y,x,z\in B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and there is some 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,z)<0$
\end_inset

.
 The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $z=y$
\end_inset

 it's ruled out easily as it will lead to a contradiction.
 Now,
 consider 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)\geq0$
\end_inset

 this means that there is 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $min_{u\in U_{i^{*}}}(u(y)-u(x))\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 By the coherency property 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i^{*}}\cap U_{j^{*}}\neq\emptyset,$
\end_inset

 this means there is at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{i^{*}}\cap U_{j^{*}}$
\end_inset

,
 but this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i^{*}}$
\end_inset

 has a 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)-u(x)\leq0$
\end_inset

 this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $min_{u\in U_{i^{*}}}(u(y)-u(x))\leq0$
\end_inset

 and in fact,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 So it remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,z)<0$
\end_inset

 it's not possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)=0$
\end_inset

 then for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)=u(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Also,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,z)<0$
\end_inset

 then for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j}$
\end_inset

 it must be that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)-u(z)<0$
\end_inset

.
 By assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in c(B)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in B$
\end_inset

.
 Then this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,z)\geq0$
\end_inset

,
 this requires that there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $j'$
\end_inset

 such that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j'}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)-u(z)\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 But this means that for this 
\begin_inset Formula $j'$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j'}$
\end_inset

 contains a 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)=u(y)$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)-u(z)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(z)-u(x)>0$
\end_inset

,
 put together 
\begin_inset Formula $u(z)>u(x)=u(y)\geq u(z)$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j'}$
\end_inset

 in order for the previous statements to be true.
 This is obviously a contradiction,
 which implies that it cannot be that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 If WARP holds,
 then by Chapter 3 in MWG (and the notes) we know that there is a complete and transitive preference relation that rationalizes the data.
 By the exercise premise we can assume that there is a utility representation 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 of that preference relation,
 then let there be a unique utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}=\{u\}$
\end_inset

 and then this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)=u(x)-u(y)=\max_{i\in\{1\}}\min_{u\in\{u\}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Problem
(Attraction Effect and Choice Overload)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
(60 points) (Too much choice/Choice overload and the Attraction Effect) Propose a model for consumer behavior that captures the following stylized facts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Choice Overload:
 Consumers are more likely to choose an outside option (that we equate in this problem to not choosing) when the size of the menu is too big.
 Hint:
 The choice set is 
\begin_inset Formula $X\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is an outside option (not in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be finite.
 Menus are of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq X$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 the outside option is always available to the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Attraction Effect:The 
\series bold
attraction effect
\series default
 is the observation that if we add an alternative to a menu,
 then some existing item becomes more attractive to the consumer and is picked by her.
 This introduced object is usually called the decoy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In formal terms,
 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-}\in X$
\end_inset

 be the decoy,
 so we are going to study its impact in the choice of the object of interest 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in X$
\end_inset

.
 The observation is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\in c(A\cup\{b^{-}\})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\notin c(A),b\in A.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You should describe with words what is the consumer choice algorithm.
 The model can be deterministic or stochastic,
 your choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 in your model and how that relates to some behavioral or bounded rationality feature we learned in class,
 and how it differs from utility maximization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally you should write the behavioral maximization problem and show how your new model predicts the two stylized facts.
 Also show,
 that the rational benchmark cannot deal with this models (neither random utility or deterministic utility maximization can predict the choice overload or attraction effect).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You should try to explain the model to me in the best way you can,
 by using words,
 diagrams and examples.
 However,
 you should have also formality,
 make the effort to write down the model using math,
 this is the only way to get full credit.
