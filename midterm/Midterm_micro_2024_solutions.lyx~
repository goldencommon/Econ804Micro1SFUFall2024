\begin_layout Problem
(20 points) Consumer Theory with the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference.
 WARP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\mathbb{R}_{+}^{L}$
\end_inset

 be the standard commodity space with 
\begin_inset Formula $L\geq2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Define a preference function 
\begin_inset Formula $r:X\times X\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 associated with a preference relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq\subseteq X\times X$
\end_inset

,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq y$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in X$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)>0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succ y$
\end_inset

).
 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq$
\end_inset

 may not be rational.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Consider the following particular model of consumer behavior.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}$
\end_inset

,
 let 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}$
\end_inset

 be a a finite collection of utilities such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U_{j}$
\end_inset

,
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u:X\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 it's a utility function that is continuous.
 Now,
 consider a consumer that has the following preferences (multiple-utilityâ€“MUâ€“model):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r(x,y)=\max_{j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}}\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y)).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Intuitively,
 this MU model says that the consumer does not have a single utility to compare between any two consumption bundles,
 it may have many such utilities.
 In order to decide if she likes 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 better than 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
 this consumer first picks the worst case over a particular criterion 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

,
 and then if there is at least one criterion (some 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))\geq0$
\end_inset

 the comparison is favorable to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

,
 then it will declare that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 (i.e.,
 the max over 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the previous statement).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A\subseteq}2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

 be a collection of menus/choice sets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We define a choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c:\mathcal{A}\to2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)\subseteq A$
\end_inset

.
 We say that a choice correspondence admits a MU preference function rationalization if
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c(A)=\{a\in A:r(a,b)\geq0\forall b\in A\},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a MU such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)=\max_{j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}}\min_{u\in U_{j}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in X$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq^{D}$
\end_inset

 be defined as the direct revealed preference such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y\iff x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succ^{D}y\iff x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $y\notin c(A)$
\end_inset

.
 We say WARP holds if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y$
\end_inset

 implies not 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Show that associated preferences 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq$
\end_inset

 to the MU preference function above may fail to be rational.
 Hint:
 Build a particular model that fails transitivity or completeness,
 that it's a MU preference function.
 You can simplify the problem assuming for this numeral only that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is finite and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 consists of tuples and triples 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y\},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Show that when the multiple criteria are coherent,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{j}\cap U_{i}\neq\emptyset$
\end_inset

,
 then a choice correspondence that admits a MU preference function rationalization satisfies WARP.
 Namely,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y$
\end_inset

 then it cannot be that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 (Partial converse) Assume now that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is such that it contains every tuple and triple choice set such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y\},\{x,y,z\}\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in X$
\end_inset

.
 Show that if a choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 defined on this collection of choice sets satisfies WARP then there is a MU preference function that rationalizes it.
 For this exercise you can assume that the preference relation that rationalizes this data set is a continuous preference relation and that 
\begin_inset Formula $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{L}$
\end_inset

.
 (Hint:
 note that we are assuming that the choice correspondence it's nonempty).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Let us say (Decision maker) she is trying to buy a car,
 and her three possible choices are a Ford,
 a Toyota,
 and a Subaru.
 The choice set is 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\{T,S,F\}$
\end_inset

.
 There are three main coalitions of utilities that are identified with the importance of different car attributes that she is endowed with:
 gas consumption (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset

),
 reliability (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{r}$
\end_inset

) and cost of maintenance (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{c}$
\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset

 coalition contains local utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{g1}$
\end_inset

 that puts on top the most gas efficient vehicles hence it ranks first Toyota then Subaru and then Ford (
\begin_inset Formula $u_{g1}(T)>u_{g1}(S)>u_{g1}(F)$
\end_inset

).
 Also it contains a second utility that ranks vehicles in terms of power versus gas consumption ranking first Ford then Toyota and then Subaru 
\begin_inset Formula $(u_{g2}(F)>u_{g1}(T)>u_{g1}(S))$
\end_inset

.
 Coalition 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{r}$
\end_inset

 contains local utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r1}$
\end_inset

 that puts on top the most reliable car in winter conditions hence ranking first Subaru then Ford and then Toyota (
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r1}(S)>u_{r1}(F)>u_{r1}(T)$
\end_inset

).
 Also,
 it contains the local utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r2}$
\end_inset

 in terms of how reliable the vehicle is on off-road conditions ranking first Ford,
 then Subaru and then Toyota 
\begin_inset Formula $(u_{r2}(F)>u_{r2}(S)>u_{r2}(T)$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This consumer is coherent so both coalitions share a common utility that takes into account gas consumption and reliability at the same time.
 According to this utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{gr}$
\end_inset

,
 Ford is ranked first then Toyota and then Subaru 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{gr}(F)>u_{gr}(T)>u_{gr}(S)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally,
 coalition 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{c}$
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{c1}$
\end_inset

 that ranks cars in terms of how expensive it is to repair them,
 the cheapest one is Subaru then Toyota and then Ford (
\begin_inset Formula $u_{c1}(S)>u_{c1}(T)>u_{c1}(F)$
\end_inset

).
 Coalition 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{c}$
\end_inset

 also contains the utilities 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{g1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{r1}$
\end_inset

 since gas consumption and reliability are related to the cost of maintenance satisfying coherency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she compares the Ford to the Toyota,
 all utilities that belong to the reliability criterion (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{g}$
\end_inset

) agree that Ford is better than Toyota,
 while the other ones are inconclusive.
 Then this consumer declares that Ford is better than Toyota (
\begin_inset Formula $F\succ T$
\end_inset

).
 However,
 when she compares the Toyota to the Subaru,
 the attribute on which she focuses is the gas efficiency because all utilities that belong to this criterion agree that Toyota is preferred to Subaru (
\begin_inset Formula $T\succ S$
\end_inset

).
 Finally,
 when comparing the Ford to the Subaru,
 she focuses on cost of maintenance,
 because according to this criterion Subaru is better than Ford for all utilities inside it 
\begin_inset Formula $(S\succ F$
\end_inset

).
 This consumer has aggregated her local rankings (local utilities) and produced a violation of transitivity as 
\begin_inset Formula $F\succ T\succ S\succ F$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 the consumer is still coherent and when facing a choice among three alternatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\{F,S,T\}$
\end_inset

 she will not violate binary consistency.
 Indeed she will remain undecided and pick nothing from this choice set.
 Coherency requires that each pair of coalitions or criteria share at least one utility in common.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in c(A)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

 it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 such that there is one 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{u\in U_{j}^{*}}(u(x)-u(y))\geq0$
\end_inset

,
 then assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

 this would mean that there is some set 
\begin_inset Formula $y,x,z\in B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and there is some 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,z)<0$
\end_inset

.
 The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $z=y$
\end_inset

 it's ruled out easily as it will lead to a contradiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case of 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)>0$
\end_inset

 also is ruled out easily as this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{**}$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $min_{u\in U^{**}}(u(y)-u(x))>0$
\end_inset

.
 By the coherency property there is at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U^{*}\cap U^{**}$
\end_inset

,
 so this will contradict the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)\geq0$
\end_inset

 as it will imply that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)<0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $z\neq y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,x)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This means that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $U\in\Omega=\{U_{j}\}_{j\in J}$
\end_inset

 there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)=u(y)$
\end_inset

 and for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)\geq u(y)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,z)<0$
\end_inset

 then for all 
\begin_inset Formula $U\in\Omega=\{U_{j}\}_{j\in J}$
\end_inset

 there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)-u(z)<0$
\end_inset

.
 By assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in c(B)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in B$
\end_inset

.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(y,z)\geq0$
\end_inset

,
 this requires that there is a 
\begin_inset Formula $U'$
\end_inset

 such that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U'$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)-u(z)\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 But this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $U'$
\end_inset

 contains a 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)\geq u(y)$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(y)-u(z)\geq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(z)-u(x)>0$
\end_inset

,
 put together we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(z)>u(x)\geq u(y)\geq u(z)$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U'$
\end_inset

 .
 This is a contradiction,
 which implies that if 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succeq^{D}y$
\end_inset

 then not 
\begin_inset Formula $y\succ^{D}x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 If WARP holds,
 then by Chapter 3 in MWG (and the notes) we know that there is a complete and transitive preference relation that rationalizes the data.
 By the exercise premise we can assume that there is a utility representation 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 of that preference relation,
 then let there be a unique utility 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}=\{u\}$
\end_inset

 and then this means that 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)=u(x)-u(y)=\max_{i\in\{1\}}\min_{u\in\{u\}}(u(x)-u(y))$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Problem
(Attraction Effect and Choice Overload)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
(60 points) (Too much choice/Choice overload and the Attraction Effect) Propose a model for consumer behavior that captures the following stylized facts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Choice Overload:
 Consumers are more likely to choose an outside option (that we equate in this problem to not choosing) when the size of the menu is too big.
 Hint:
 The choice set is 
\begin_inset Formula $X\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 is an outside option (not in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be finite.
 Menus are of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq X$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 the outside option is always available to the consumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Attraction Effect:The 
\series bold
attraction effect
\series default
 is the observation that if we add an alternative to a menu,
 then some existing item becomes more attractive to the consumer and is picked by her.
 This introduced object is usually called the decoy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In formal terms,
 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-}\in X$
\end_inset

 be the decoy,
 so we are going to study its impact in the choice of the object of interest 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in X$
\end_inset

.
 The observation is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\in c(A\cup\{b^{-}\})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\notin c(A),b\in A.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In probabilities,
 it means that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(b,A\cup\{b^{-}\})>p(b,A).
\]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You should describe with words what is the consumer choice algorithm.

 and how it differs from utility maximization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally you should write the behavioral maximization problem and show how your new model predicts the two stylized facts.
 Also show,
 that the rational benchmark cannot deal with this models (neither random utility or deterministic utility maximization can predict the choice overload or attraction effect).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You should try to explain the model to me in the best way you can,
 by using words,
 diagrams and examples.
 However,
 you should have also formality,
 make the effort to write down the model using math,
 this is the only way to get full credit.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
My model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be a finite set of choices,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 a default,
 the grand choice set is 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}=X\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

.
 The menus are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}\subseteq2^{X^{*}}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 has at least two elements 
\begin_inset Formula $|A|\geq2$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $o\in A$
\end_inset

 always.
 This default is always present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer is endowed with a utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $u:X^{*}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(o)=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer also has an attention index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta:2^{X}\setminus\{o\}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 that assigns how much attention does she pays to a bundle of items,
 e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\{a,b,o\})=3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\{a,o\})=\eta(\{b,o\})=1$
\end_inset

 means that the consumer pays more attention to 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 when they are together than alone.
 We let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\emptyset)=-\infty$
\end_inset

,
 we also let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(D)=-\infty$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $o\notin D.$
\end_inset

 Now let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{A}(\{o\})=|A|$
\end_inset

 for every menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that for all other bundles that are not 
\begin_inset Formula $\{o\}$
\end_inset

 the attention index is always the same across menus,
 but for the default it changes with the cardinality.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{A}(D)=\eta(D)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $A\neq\{o\}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This consumer is stochastic,
 so she will choose how much attention to pay to different alternatives solving the following problem.
 Attention is given as the probability of considering 
\begin_inset Formula $B\subseteq A$
\end_inset

 for menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This is modelled as 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{A}\in\Delta(2^{A})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{A}^{*}=argmax_{m_{A}\in\Delta(2^{A})}\sum_{D\subseteq A}(m_{A}(D)\eta_{A}(D)-K(\eta_{A}(D))).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\eta(D))=\theta\eta_{A}(D)\log\eta_{A}(D)$
\end_inset

 is a convex cost function,
 in fact it is an entropy cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under this we get that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{A}(D)=\frac{exp(\theta\eta_{A}(D))}{\sum_{B\subseteq A}exp(\theta\eta_{A}(B))}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 we can compute the probability of choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\mathcal{A}:$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{A}(a)=\sum_{D\subseteq A}1(u(a)>u(b)\forall b\in D\setminus\{a\})m_{A}(D).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the probability of choice is the expected frequency of times 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the best item among the consideration set 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is a random realization of the random consideration set distributed with 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{A}\in\Delta(2^{A})$
\end_inset

,
 choice is random.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Choice overload
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\{a,b,c\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(a)=3,u(b)=2,u(c)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(o)=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer picks 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 only with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{A}(\{o\})$
\end_inset

,
 so we want 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{B}(\{o\})>m_{A}(\{o\})$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $B\supset A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need the following attention index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\{a,o\})=\eta(\{b,o\})=\eta(\{c,o\})=1$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\{a,b,o\})=\eta(\{b,c,o\})=\eta(\{a,c,o\})=2$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(\{a,b,c,o\})=3$
\end_inset

.
 We have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{A}(\{o\})=|A|$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default is easy to understand,
 so the attention index 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{A}(\{o\})$
\end_inset

 measures the opportunity cost of paying to attention to any item that is not the default.
